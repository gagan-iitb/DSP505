# DSP505
Programming for Data Science and AI

# Overview
This course is designed for students from various non-CS backgrounds and prepares them for a career in data science and artificial intelligence.
We will begin with a high-level understanding of the data science process and expose the students to various types of datasets: tabular, text, time series, images, etc. We begin with data exploration, data cleaning, and data representation. Analysis of data requires us to represent it mathematically. 
Next comes model building and evaluation. At this stage, we need feature engineering.
Finally, we need to present the analysis to various stakeholders.
Data Science is an iterative process and requires us to refine the above steps and repeat them till we get good results.
